# üå∏ Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

## üìå Objective

The goal of this project is to classify iris flowers into one of three species ‚Äî *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica* ‚Äî based on their petal and sepal measurements. Using the Iris dataset, we aim to build a supervised machine learning model that can accurately predict the species of a given iris flower.

## üîç Steps Performed

1. **Data Collection**  
   - The Iris dataset was loaded using `sklearn.datasets` or downloaded externally.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Checked for missing values, data types, and class distributions.
   - Converted the dataset into a suitable format for training.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized data using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to understand relationships between features.
   - Plotted pair plots, heatmaps, and histograms.

4. **Model Training**  
   - Applied machine learning algorithms including:
     - Logistic Regression  
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (typically 80/20 split).

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
   - Selected the best-performing model.

6. **Prediction**  
   - Used the trained model to predict the species of new samples.
